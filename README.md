# FracturedIdentity
A puzzle platformer game made for TSA

So the original idea for this game is that there are characters who are locked in an XY plane but each character is on a different value of the Z axis.
Then there would be some interactions and items that would be able to move through the Z axis so that would be used as a puzzle mechanics.
Right now the game just uses 2D graphics so I haven't been able to figure out a good way to depict to the player the fact that the two characters are right next
to each other on adjacent Z axes. So currently it's just more of a standard puzzle platformer with two characters, somewhat inspired by Fireboy and Watergirl.
